Welcome to the gazillionth reboot of this blog - this time nicknamed The Shell.

So what's with the name you ask?

Well, the shell is what I've decided that it is going to be about - small
tidbits of knowledge that I can share from a decade or two of using [Bash][bash]
on a daily basis - but also a place where I get the incentive to learn more and
document my findings.

I hope you will find something of interest!
